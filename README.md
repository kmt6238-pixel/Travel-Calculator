This project takes two cities and their respective countries and gives the distance as well as the time it takes to get there by walking, driving, and flying.
It is assumed that a person who walks moves at an average speed of 5 km/hr, a person who drives moves at an average speed of 60 km/hr, and a person who flies in a plane moves at an average speed of 800 km/hr.
